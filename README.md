# Markdown Evolution Proposals

This document will approach three types of proposals.

- **patch:** these proposals are compatible with the current markdown and their transpilers.
- **superset:** the proposals here are an evolution that accept the current syntax and new features.
- **breaking change:** a new version that override the old markdown syntax

Each type of proposal is divided in two use cases:

- **for document:** the original reason to markdown exist, to be a web markup language to create text documents
- **for web pages:** Markdown is an HTML superset, the idea is to make it render more complex pages, no only documents, then these proposal bring new common components for content of web pages.
